    <h3 class="headline scroll-animated">About Me</h3>

    <p class="scroll-animated">  
        
    I've honed my skills through a diverse array of roles from working as a Certified Public Accountant, Internal Auditor, and Product Manager. This varied experience has provided me with a unique perspective in understanding business needs and driving results. Currently, I'm dedicated to developing dashboard frameworks, utilizing data assets to enhance operational efficiency and financial outcomes. Above all, I thrive on forging meaningful connections every step of the way.</p>

    <p> Outside my professional endeavors, I'm deeply committed to promoting diversity and inclusion within the construction industry. I've actively contributed to this cause by being a part of my organization’s Women in Construction Committees at both the local and national level. Through these leadership roles and advocacy efforts, I strive to create pathways for diverse talent to thrive.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of analytics and strategy, you'll find me on stage as a stand-up performer, strumming tunes on my guitar, exploring picturesque cycling routes, diving into the depths as a scuba enthusiast, and enthusiastically learning Spanish to maintain my Duolingo streak. I also find joy in hosting dinner parties and nurturing a yoga and meditation practice to maintain balance in life.</p>
    
    <p>I'm always enthusiastic about connecting with like-minded professionals who share my passion for excellence and innovation. Whether it's diving into the latest industry trends or exploring potential collaborations, I'm excited to connect with you. Let's build a better tomorrow!</p>

                                    our initiatives from the ground-up. The pandemic halted the STWIC Committee's
                                    initiatives therefore, we had to develop new leads and partners. This role included
                                    researching and evaluating local charities to contribute to and form partnerships with.
                                    We also hosted and curated events, internally and externally which included:</p>

                                    <li>Education workshop for highschool women interested in STEM.</li>
